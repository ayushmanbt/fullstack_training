# Day 9 - FastAPI application

This is the express base application we created this week

- We added a `.gitignore` file to ignore the `env` folder
- FastAPI has a more type based approach if you see my code for POST request
- It gives automatic documentation for your api
- For you to test this application you need to create your own environment with python3 `python3 -m venv env` and then source that environment (depends on your system) then install the requirements using `pip install -r requirements.txt` Then you can run this app using `fastapi dev main.py`
