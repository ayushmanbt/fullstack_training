# Day 7 : Todo Application Revisited

Today we revisited the todo list application, this time with react. 

- We learnt and used `useState()` for central state mangement
- We used `useEffect()` to observe changes of a variable 
- We used `uesRef()` to reference an HTML element
- We learnt how to pass variables and functions to child element via props. 
- We learnt about object destructuring `{...}` and how this can be used to extract old values from array and extract the new value
- This code has a potential problem, whoever identifies the problem and solves that gets their choice of lunch from the nescafe store next day from me. (do not consider the refreshing refreshes the list as the error). (Also you have to come up and explain how you solved it, a pull request beforehand will be better) (Only 1 prize) (No one claimed it)
